# velorant-password-manager
This application is a randome password generater. 
It stores your email id and randomely generated passwords in the database so that you can copy and use the password later
there is a dedicated copy button given so you don't have to go through the hassel of selecting the password and copying it 

Note: I used SQLite database in this application
